        <h2>Free RTK</h2>
		<p>As I said in the home page, the main function of the server this website is running on is to provide free rtk to our farm, and then to anyone on the internet. But it's only worth anything if you're less than 20 miles away. I live a few miles north of Galva, KS, so this base should cover the McPherson, Canton, Moundridge area, with Hillsboro and Hesston very close to the limit... <br>
		Anyways, here's the credentials: <br> <br>
		URL: davidwedel.com <br>
		MountPoint: OverlandRTK <br>
		Port: 2101 <br>
		Username: aog <br>
		Password: aog <br><br>
		
		Enter these in your NTRIP Client, and it should start streaming the NTRIP data.
